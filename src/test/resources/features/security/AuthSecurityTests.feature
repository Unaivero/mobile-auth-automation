Feature: Authentication Security Testing
  As a security tester
  I want to verify the security of the authentication mechanisms
  So that user data remains protected and secure

  Background:
    Given the mobile application is installed
    And the security testing tools are configured

  @security @critical
  Scenario: JWT token security validation
    When a user successfully authenticates
    Then the JWT token should have the correct structure
    And the JWT token should not contain sensitive information
    And the JWT token signature should be valid
    And the JWT token should have an appropriate expiry time
    And the JWT token should be properly encrypted

  @security @critical
  Scenario: Security headers validation
    When a request is made to the authentication endpoints
    Then the following security headers should be present
      | header                    | value                                       |
      | X-Content-Type-Options    | nosniff                                     |
      | X-Frame-Options           | DENY                                        |
      | Content-Security-Policy   | frame-ancestors 'none'                      |
      | Strict-Transport-Security | max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload|
      | X-XSS-Protection          | 1; mode=block                               |
    And no sensitive information should be exposed in headers

  @security @session
  Scenario: Session timeout enforcement
    Given a user is authenticated with valid credentials
    When the session is inactive for the configured timeout period
    Then the session should expire automatically
    And accessing protected resources should require re-authentication
    And the system should log the session expiration event

  @security @session
  Scenario: Session fixation protection
    Given a user has an unauthenticated session
    When the user authenticates successfully
    Then a new session ID should be generated
    And the old session ID should no longer be valid
    And the system should log the session ID change event

  @security @cookies
  Scenario: Cookie security attributes validation
    When authentication cookies are set
    Then all authentication cookies should have the Secure flag
    And all authentication cookies should have the HttpOnly flag
    And all authentication cookies should have appropriate SameSite attribute
    And authentication cookies should have appropriate expiration

  @security @logout
  Scenario: Secure logout implementation
    Given a user is authenticated with valid credentials
    When the user performs a logout
    Then the session should be invalidated on the server
    And all authentication cookies should be cleared
    And the user should be redirected to the login screen
    And accessing protected resources should require re-authentication

  @security @brute-force
  Scenario: Brute force protection
    When an attacker attempts multiple failed logins for the same account
    Then the system should implement rate limiting
    And the system should temporarily lock the account after multiple failures
    And the system should notify the legitimate user of suspicious activity

  @security @zap @automated
  Scenario: OWASP ZAP security scan on authentication endpoints
    When a ZAP security scan is performed on the authentication endpoints
    Then there should be no high severity findings
    And there should be no medium severity authentication vulnerabilities
    And all security scan results should be documented

  @security @sensitive-data
  Scenario: Protection of sensitive data in logs and errors
    When authentication failures occur
    Then error messages should not reveal sensitive information
    And authentication credentials should not be logged
    And stack traces should not be exposed to users
    And detailed error information should be logged securely for troubleshooting
